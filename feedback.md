I went through the two tutorials listed below. This seemed to be an easier starting point than the docs. 

I used async/await instead of promises like in the tutorial. One issue was with creating a chat client. The way to do it in the tutorial didn't work with the newest version of twilio-chat(2.1.0) so I just installed the version used in the tutorial which was 1.1.1.
